    description: |
      An interrupt is raised when a distance measurement is ready.
      GPIO1 is the interrupt pin on the VL53L5CX (active low). This
      can be disabled if the user prefers to use polling instead.

  rst-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Driving the RST pin low resets the VL53L5CX. This is optional
      and can be omitted if the sensor is reset by other means.
