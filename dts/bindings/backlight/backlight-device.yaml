# Common fields for backlight devices

include: base.yaml

properties:
  default-brightness:
    type: int
    description: |
      The default brightness that should be applied to the LED by the operating
      system on start-up. The brightness should not exceed the brightness the
      LED can provide.

  max-brightness:
    type: int
    description: |
      Normally the maximum brightness is determined by the hardware and this
      property is not required. This property is used to put a software limit
      on the brightness apart from what the driver says, as it could happen
      that a LED can be made so bright that it gets damaged or causes damage
      due to restrictions in a specific system, such as mounting conditions.
